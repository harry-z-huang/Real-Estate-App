Real estate websites bring convenience to buyers and exposure to sellers. 
They are easy ways for home buyers to advertise their property and even easier for home buyers to compare many different potential homes while shopping. 
Real estate listing websites are a central hub for all the properties offered up for sale in a given area. 
They usually offer many different ways to filter/sort real estate for sale within a certain geographical area.
